The Office of GIS at the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC), the Metropolitan Planning Organization for the Greater Philadelphia Region, recognizes the importance of reliable geospatial datasets and user friendly web mapping applications. With this in mind, DVRPC has created a workflow, structure and standards that utilize ArcGIS Server and ArcGIS Open Data Portal. These elements assist DVRPC staff, their planning partners, transit agencies, researchers, and the public with making data-driven decisions. Learn how DVRPC prepares and published regional GIS datasets; workflow and standards for building web mapping applications; the importance of metadata; and how to add rich content and functionality into your projects.

The U.S. Census Bureau collects data on people who have Limited English Proficiency (LEP), persons who speak English "less than very well". Over the past few years, there has been an increase in these LEP population groups through out the US. Learn how DVRPC is mapping and analyzing these LEP population that are living within a diverse and mixed regional area. This presentation will talk about how the data was collected and analyzed, the different thematic mapping approaches used to visualize the data, and how other agencies can map LEP in their region or town....and Finally! the LEP dataset is one that can be used to make insightful and colorful maps using ArcGIS Pro.
